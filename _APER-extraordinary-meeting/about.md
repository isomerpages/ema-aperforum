The Extraordinary Meeting will provide a platform for APER members to share the regulatory challenges and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their countries, learn from each otherâ€™s best practices and responses, and exchange views on the future of energy post COVID-19.  This would also be an opportunity for APER members to touch base this year, while we work towards a physical meeting in 2021.
