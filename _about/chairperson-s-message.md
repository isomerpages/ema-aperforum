The Energy Market Authority is pleased to host the Extraordinary Meeting of the Asia Pacific Energy Regulatory (APER) Forum virtually on 14 August 2020. <br>

The global energy landscape has been significantly impacted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertain economic outlook.  At the same time, this crisis could help accelerate the transition to a more secure and sustainable energy future when the global economy recovers. Globally, many economies are experiencing increased electrification of the transportation, building and industrial sectors.  Their energy markets are evolving to respond to rapid changes in demand and supply brought about by the energy transition.  Against this backdrop, our role as energy regulators is even more critical to ensure long-term stability and resilience of power systems while facilitating the energy transformation.<br>

The Extraordinary Meeting will provide a platform for members to share the regulatory challenges and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in our respective countries, learn from each otherâ€™s best practices and responses, and exchange views on how we can prepare our energy systems for future disruptions. This website will be updated regularly with information on the Extraordinary Meeting programme and other administrative arrangements.<br>

I look forward to the fruitful discussions.<br><br>
